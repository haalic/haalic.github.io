      <p>
        Hasan Ali Çelik was born in 1941, in the village of Çat (now Çağlayan) in the Taurus Mountains near Konya, Turkey.  After finishing the village elementary school, he was able to get into the İvriz Village   Institution in 1953, which ended up a steppingstone for Çelik to further his education in various schools and universities in İstanbul and Ankara in Turkey, and in USA. 
      </p>
     Çelik studied four years in the boarding school, İvriz Village   Institution, where he learned and excelled in playing violin, which enabled him to transfer to Çapa Teacher Training School in Istanbul, in 1957. In 1959, he was selected to join the newly established school Advanced Teacher Training School in conjunction with the University of Ankara, studying mathematics and astronomy. In 1962, he transferred to the Middle East Technical University, (METU), earning Batcheler and master’s degrees in 1964 and 1965. While working as an adjunct faculty at METU, Çelik earned a scholarship in 1966 to study for a Ph.D. degree in USA. After graduating with a PH.D. degree in mathematics from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1971, Dr. Çelik wanted to go back to his home country Turkey but METU did not renew his contract. He then became a faculty member of the Department of Mathematics at the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, (Cal Poly, Pomona), in 1971.
